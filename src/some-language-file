// Things to keep in mind when writing a hello world server in the language. 

// - The server starts on 0.0.0.0 to handle outbound connection in a docker container
// - The server is listening on port 80
// - The code is clear and preferrably documented
// - The logs display the port number the server is listening on 
// - The static files are served from the /views directory with negligible changes in order to get consistency among all hello-world examples.
